# No Breaks During Raids

This is a mod for Rimworld that disables the ability for pawns to get mental breaks when an enemy faction is on the map. This prevents pawns from wandering off into the middle of a gun fight because they ate without a table.
This obviously breaks balancing and is not a mod meant for a QoL only modlist. This was just a project I set out to do to get to know the inner workings of the game and is, hopefully, the first of many.

### Stuff im still undecided on:
  * Should pawns exit mental breaks when an enemy enters the map?

### Installation
To install this mod just download the latest release [here](https://github.com/Mapc1/NoBreaksDuringRaids/releases) and extract the zip inside the mods folder located wherever you have Rimworld installed.
